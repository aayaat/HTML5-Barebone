  Asslamu alaykum! Welcome to ‘the introduction to the life of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him).’ There has never been
  a human being so well-respected, loved and followed as Muhammad (pbuh), the final messenger of Allah. There has never been
  a person who has changed world history so dramatically as Muhammad (pbuh) and his message. The Prophet (pbuh) was the single
  most important person in the history of the world.
</p>

<p>
   The reason for Muhammad’s (pbuh) success was that he was sent with a pure message from Allah, the creator of all mankind.
  This message would help us understand how to live our lives. It would tell us about good and bad and about wrong and right.
  This message would tell us about mankind (about you and me), the universe and the rest of creation around us. This message
  would tell us about Allah and about our relationship with Allah. The message also told us about the Hereafter, the Day of
  Judgment, Heaven and Hell.
</p>

<p>
   The Qu'ran is this pure message that was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago. These are the words of Allah that were sent
  to the prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Allah has guarded it and kept it pure from changes and errors. The purpose or mission of
  the prophet (pbuh) was to deliver this message to Mankind and to follow its teachings.
